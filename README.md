# gameoflife
Cellular Automata simulation using Java FX. 

## Running the Program

 * Main class: The Main class is essentially a scenecontroller that generates a simulation scene including every front-end feautures. 

 * Data files needed: XML File as an input, Property file, style file, and images files. 

## Features:

### 7 Models
* Foraging Ants
* Tumor (An detailed explanation is on the NetLogo website, it tries to simulate a tumor in human body)
* Game of Life
* Spreading of Fire
* Percolation
* Schelling's model of segregation
* waTor Predator and Prey Model

### Other Features 
* Allow users to run any number of simulations at the same time so they can compare the results side by side
* Allow users to interact with any simulation values dynamically such that each change takes immediate effect on the current simulation
* Error checking for incorrect file data
* Allow the initial configuration of the cell states to be set in different ways
* Allow any aspect of a simulation to be "styled" 
* Support the user to manipulate the speed of the animation. 
* Support checking current Statistics
* Support the user to upload/save the initial/current states of the cell.
* Support the user to play and pause animation at any time, and move one step further at any stage.
